# Variables Notes

We have already seen how to use variables in our programs. In this section we will look at how to declare variables and how to use them in our programs.

## Declaring Variables

In order to use a variable in a program we must first declare it. This is done using the type of the variable followed by the name of the variable. For example:

```c
int x;
```

This declares a variable called `x` of type `int` and then assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`. We can then use the variable `x` in our program. For example:

```c
int x;

x = 5;

printf("%d", x);
```
